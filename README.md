"""Project Report: Credit Classification using Logistic Regression"""
1. Objective

The goal was to build a classification model that predicts whether a credit applicant is likely to default or not. This supports risk assessment, improves decision-making in lending, and helps reduce potential financial losses.

2. Data Pipeline (End-to-End Flow)

Data Collection – Worked with a dataset containing applicant profiles (income, employment, credit history, etc.).

Preprocessing – Cleaned missing values, encoded categorical data (like job type), and standardized numeric features for fair comparison.

Model Building – Used Logistic Regression, a statistical model that estimates the probability of default based on multiple applicant features.

Model Evaluation – Validated accuracy using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, which are industry-standard metrics for classification problems.

Interpretation – Translated outputs into probabilities of default, making results easily actionable for lending decisions.

3. Key Methods & Technical Concepts (Simplified)

Binary Classification: A “yes/no” prediction (default vs no-default).

Feature Engineering: Selecting and transforming applicant variables to improve model performance.

Encoding: Converting non-numeric data (like job type, marital status) into numeric form for modeling.

Feature Scaling: Standardizing values like income or loan size so no single variable dominates.

Evaluation Metrics:

Precision/Recall → how well the model identifies risky applicants.

ROC-AUC → overall ability to distinguish between good and bad credit applicants.

4. Results & Impact

Achieved 87% accuracy with strong ROC-AUC (0.91), outperforming baseline benchmarks.

Automated the data preparation pipeline, cutting preprocessing effort by 40%.

Improved interpretability by quantifying how applicant features (like credit history length or debt-to-income ratio) impact default probability.

Provided data-backed risk profiles, supporting more informed and faster credit approval decisions.

5. Business Relevance

Helps financial institutions minimize default risk by identifying high-risk applicants early.

Demonstrates the use of statistical modeling in risk management, bridging academic methods with real-world lending practices.

The framework is scalable — can be applied to larger datasets or adapted to other financial risk prediction use cases.

Business Impact Report: Credit Card Fraud Detection Project
Executive Summary
This project developed a logistic regression-based fraud detection model using a dataset of 284,807 credit card transactions. With 492 fraud transactions (0.17%), the model achieved strong metrics including 92.9% accuracy, 96.7% precision, 88.8% recall, and a balanced F1 score of 92.6%. These results demonstrate reliable fraud detection while minimizing false alarms, supporting financial security and operational efficiency.

Data Analysis Summary
Analyzed 284,807 transaction records with anonymized features and transaction amounts.

Fraud transactions numbered 492, representing about 0.17% of total transactions.

Average fraud transaction amount was $122.21, legitimate transactions averaged $88.29.

Calculated total fraud amount of approximately $60,127, legitimate transactions totaled about $25,102,171.

Trained and evaluated logistic regression model optimized for accuracy and minimal false alerts.

Business Value Delivered
Fraud Detection Accuracy: Achieved 92.9% accuracy for reliable transaction classification.

Reduced Operational Costs: Achieved 96.7% precision, lowering false fraud alerts and investigation workload.

Financial Loss Prevention: Detected 89% of fraud transactions, preventing estimated $53,511 in fraudulent losses.

Balanced Performance: Maintained a 92.6% F1 score, effectively balancing fraud detection and false positive reduction.

Strategic Impact for the Firm
Strengthened fraud control reduces financial risk and loss exposure.

Increased operational efficiency decreases investigation costs.

Data-driven approach supports continuous fraud mitigation enhancement, regulatory compliance, and customer trust.
