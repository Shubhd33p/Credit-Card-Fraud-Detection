Business Impact Report: Credit Card Fraud Detection Project
Executive Summary
This project developed a logistic regression-based fraud detection model using a dataset of 284,807 credit card transactions. With 492 fraud transactions (0.17%), the model achieved strong metrics including 92.9% accuracy, 96.7% precision, 88.8% recall, and a balanced F1 score of 92.6%. These results demonstrate reliable fraud detection while minimizing false alarms, supporting financial security and operational efficiency.

Data Analysis Summary
Analyzed 284,807 transaction records with anonymized features and transaction amounts.

Fraud transactions numbered 492, representing about 0.17% of total transactions.

Average fraud transaction amount was $122.21, legitimate transactions averaged $88.29.

Calculated total fraud amount of approximately $60,127, legitimate transactions totaled about $25,102,171.

Trained and evaluated logistic regression model optimized for accuracy and minimal false alerts.

Business Value Delivered
Fraud Detection Accuracy: Achieved 92.9% accuracy for reliable transaction classification.

Reduced Operational Costs: Achieved 96.7% precision, lowering false fraud alerts and investigation workload.

Financial Loss Prevention: Detected 89% of fraud transactions, preventing estimated $53,511 in fraudulent losses.

Balanced Performance: Maintained a 92.6% F1 score, effectively balancing fraud detection and false positive reduction.

Strategic Impact for the Firm
